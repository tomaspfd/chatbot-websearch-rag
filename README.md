## üöÄ Features

- **Plug-and-Play LLM**: Easily switch between using local models (via Ollama) or API-based models (Gemini).
- **CrewAI-Powered**: Modular agent/task structure for clean logic.

  - ChatBot: persistent chat history and model/tool selectors, as well as a button for clearing conversation history.
