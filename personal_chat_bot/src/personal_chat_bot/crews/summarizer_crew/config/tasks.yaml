summarize_chat:
  description: >
    Summarize the following portion of a chat conversation.
    Focus on capturing the key points, decisions, questions, or emotional tone from the user and assistant.
    Keep in mind that the summary you produce will serve as memory for another agent that is interacting with the user.

    Conversation to summarize:
    {conversation_to_summarize}
    In the {conversation_to_summarize}, you will find the user prompts as "User: ...", the chatbot's responses as 
    "Assistant: ...", and the previous summary that was generated as "System: Conversation Summary: ...". All three
    should be combined into the new summary. The total length of the summary should not exceed 500 words.
  expected_output: >
    A concise paragraph summarizing the conversation so far. Avoid generalities â€” preserve meaningful user context.
